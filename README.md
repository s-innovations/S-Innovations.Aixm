# S-Innovations.Aixm

This is not a complete project, it was me puzzling with the idea of making a library that was easily maintained for the purpose of converting axim and geojson.

Theres a small console app that converts a axim document to geosjon and then I didnt finish the converting back problem yet.

Use it as one see fit.
